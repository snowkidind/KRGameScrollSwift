=====//=====

Swift Version of game scroller.

Integration Notes

The purpose of this program is to provide a method with which to manage 
multiple menu pages and present it in a scroller like fashion, either 
horizontally or vertically. It contains navigation boxes that tell you what 
page you are on. 

The reasoning behind such a class is because it is complicated to add
UIView Items directly to a spriteKit scene. In order to do that, you must
tell the view controller to add the subview. In most cases where a simple
scrolling window is needed, you can just add this object to your scene
and display custom pages directly from your scene, without involving
the ViewController. In the case of KRGameScroll, there is no "view"
object, only a nicely fitting node along the spriteKit node tree.


More to come, the project is under construction...
